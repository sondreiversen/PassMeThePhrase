# PassMeThePhrase

This is my first proper python project.

The script uses python secrets for diceware in an attempt to create random generated passphrases. 
As for now, I aam using the eff wordlists for picking  words.
User can specify the short or large eff wordlist as well as length of passphrase generated.
